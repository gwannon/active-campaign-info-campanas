# active-campaign-info-campanas
Simple dashboard to see the main statistics of the ActiveCampaign campaigns as well as heatmap of the newsletter clicks.

Copy config.php.dist as config.php and edit it with your ActiveCampaign API connection and database connection details. Use messages.sql to create the table where to store the html of the campaigns.

Greetings and enjoy :)
